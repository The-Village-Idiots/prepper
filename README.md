# **prepper** - prep lab organisation software

prepper is a web application designed for self-hosting by schools for organising activities which need preparation by a prep lab. It was written for my A-Level computer science project 2024. It is basically a CRUD booking system with some extra data processing features for convenience.

I wrote this as my school was, at the time, organising practical science activities by writing down bookings on a scrap of paper and handing them to the single, very overworked technician who then had to manually organise all of them. I have endeavoured to make this as organised as possible, in contrast to the old system. I don't expect this to be particularly applicable to many other situations, but please feel free to use it anyway, should you see fit.

## Contributions

I intended this to be more or less a time capsule for the state the project was in when I submitted it, so I might be a little picky about what I add or update. If you are actually intending to deploy this somewhere for use in the real world and need something modifying, please feel free to let me know and I can modify it and/or merge into this copy.
